# CDN-RecSys: A Network That Works

An implementation of the LightFM hybrid recommender system for suggesting CDN (content delivery network) 
providers to various websites. 
Created at Tsinghua University's Big Data Technology R&D Center as part of USC Viterbi's Research Abroad program.

### Introduction

Spent 6 weeks in China!

Chinese government makes ICPs (internet content providers) register with info like their industry, 
so I figured I'd put that to use.

### Project Steps

1. Get up-to-date up on CDNs, Recommender Systems
2. Obtain CDN/ICP dataset
3. Parse out dataset
4. Extract features
5. Create RecSys models
6. Evaluate RecSys models


### Results

Good stuff


## Built With

* LightFM
* Scikit-optimize
* numpy/scipy (I'd assume this is implied at this point)
